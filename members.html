He brought together representatives of the first seven member countries in Paris for the signing of FIFA's foundation act and agreement of the first FIFA statutes.

He has been banned from participating in FIFA activities since 2015 as a result of the FIFA corruption case made public that year, and will remain banned until 2027.

                            From a background in business, public relations, and sports administration, Blatter became general secretary of FIFA in 1981 and was then elected president at the 51st FIFA Congress on 8 June 1998, succeeding João Havelange, who had headed the organization since 1974. Blatter was re-elected in 2002, 2007, 2011, and 2015.</p>

            It will be a secret ballot, and all Fifa's 209 member states have a vote each. Members vote in alphabetical order, and it will take some time.

In the first round, if either of the candidates wins two-thirds of the vote - a total of 140 votes if everyone takes part - then he wins.

If there is no outright winner at the end of the first round, a candidate would need to win only a straight majority in a second round of voting.
